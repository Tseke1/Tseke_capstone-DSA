# Tseke_capstone-DSA
My first project on SQL while taking my data analysis course with The Incubator Hub

## Project Topic- KMS Business Intelligence Analysis (2009-2012)
### Project Overview
The primary objective for this project is to assess customer behavior, product performance, shipping efficiency and profitability across regions, segments and categories using SQL-driven analytics. In this analysis, I am expected to
-  Identify top-performing products, customers, and regions.
-  Track down cost inefficiencies
-  Highlight underperforming segments
-  Recommend data approved strategies for revenue growth
### Data Source
Order Data (CSV File) which contains transactional records from 2009-2012, including:
- Order date, quantity, Sales, profit, shipping cost, shipping mode
- Customer details: name, segment, region, province
- Product details: category, sub-category, container.
Order Status Data (CSV File)	
This file contains data which includes returned order IDs and status information.
### Tools Used
-	MS Excel  [Download Here]
- For data cleaning
- 	For data collection
- 		SQL server
  ``` SQL
  SELECT A,B,C
  WHERE A>15
  ```
-	For querying
-	For conducting analysis
### Data Preparation
The file gotten from excel which contained the data from 2009-2012 required little to no cleaning. I started by creating a database on SQL for the project then continued with the following prompt
- Importation of data from ms excel into SQL
-	Create Table in SQL
-	Validate date
-	Execute as needed
  # Case Scenario 1
## product with the highest category

#### Insight: Technology had the highest total sales of â€“between 2009-2012
#### Interpretation: Technology contributes largely to the revenue and may indicate higher demand and pricing in that category
